V1.0.2
--------
 * Removed an old workaround about translations, which prevented some languages from being loaded due to a recent change in Qt.
 * Check for nullity of `QDrag` before calling `deleteLater()` on it.
 * Added LZ4 support.

V1.0.1
--------
 * Replaced the deprecated method QMouseEvent::pos().
 * Removed 'application/x-ace' from the supported archives (it was never really supported).
 * Localized sizes.
 * Show sizes with one decimal, if needed.
 * Replaced `QtGlobal` methods and types (like `qMax`, `qMin`, `qreal`, …) with those of C++.

V1.0.0
--------
 * Removed Qt5 support and bumped the minimum required version of Qt to 6.6.
 * Added unadvertised support for 'application/vnd.snap'.
 * Check the existence of "gio" before using it for opening URLs.

V0.12.0
--------
 * Made it possible to modify files inside archives.
 * Added an option for using system icons.
 * Made sure that "No" is the default button of question dialogs (Qt seems to have a minor problem in this regard).
 * Don't start extraction if the archive is removed.
 * Made viewing/extracting of single files much faster with bsdtar.
 * Consistently prevent the parent extraction folder from being hidden (for it not to be missed by the user).
 * Fixed a bug in removal of files from archives.
 * Make sure that ed-like special characters are escaped when making path patterns with bsdtar.
 * Added a workaround for a nasty bug in bsdtar about start backslashes and the option "--strip-components".
 * Added new mimetype names of `shared-mime-info` ≥ 2.3.

V0.11.0
--------
 * Added "View current item" to the "View" menu.
 * Simplified finding of Qt modules with cmake.
 * Corrected context menus on Wayland, by specifying their parent widget.
 * Removed the option about fitting the first column (because it could make the first column almost invisible).
 * Allow opening of `dmg` files by drag-and-drop without advertising it.
 * Protect the file type filters of file dialogs from bad translations.

V0.10.0
--------
 * Considered the modes of emblemized icons. This is especially relevant to Qt icon engines that colorize selected symbolic icons.
 * Get the mimetypes of symlinks directly, without consulting their targets (because their targets may be symlinks themselves and so, they aren't reliable).
 * First try the file manager DBus interface when opening the containing folder.
 * Removed the action for opening the containing folder when running as root (because there are DBus complications with most file managers).
 * Added read-only support for VirtualBox Extension Pack.
 * With 7z, don't show password prompt when the archive can't be read and there's no mention of encryption.
 * Enabled compilation against Qt6. With cmake, "ENABLE_QT5" should be set to "OFF" (as in `cmake .. -DENABLE_QT5=OFF`) — it's "ON" by default.

V0.9.0
--------
 * Show childless directories whose names contain the filtering string.
 * Fixed viewing or removing of files that have wildcard characters in their names with bsdtar (by escaping some wildcard characters that come after "--include").
 * Better smooth scrolling from inside the view (especially with touchpad).
 * Added read-only support for AppImage bundle through 7z.
 * When viewing a file in a password protected archive, ask the password again if a nonempty, wrong password is entered.
 * When viewing files, warn the user of links without targets instead of trying to open them.

--------
 * Added a workaround for a problem in QCollator.
 * Added an option for expanding top level directories when loading archives.
 * Resize columns appropriately on expanding a directory item.

 * Added a workaround for Qt's problem with scrolling to deep nonexpanded tree items.
 * Always expand the first header column to fill the available width.
 * Added cmake support (in addition to qmake).
 * Allow dragging of all selected items, including probable directories.
 * Add milliseconds to the name of the cache folder that's used for temporary extraction because multiple archives may be loaded almost simultaneously.
 * Show the compressed size prefixed by "≥" if the file size is missing.

V0.7.0
--------
 * Handle newlines and text tabs in item names as far as possible.
 * Natural sorting of items by treating dot as a separator.
 * Set the window title to the archive name.
 * Added context menu to the archive path bar for copying path and opening containing folder.
 * Use 7z for uncompressed disk images and bsdtar for compressed ones.
 * Added fallback icons for files and folders.

--------
 * Added read-only support for RAR archives through 7z.

V0.6.0
--------
 * Added an option to (not) stretch the first column.
 * Added app icon.

 * Scroll to the current item when expanding or filtering.
 * Fixed startup invisibility with some window managers.
 * Updated the code for Qt 5.15.

V0.5.0
---------
 * Added read-only support for MS Windows packages through 7z.
 * Accept 7z lists without Date and Time (may happen with MS Windows packages).
 * Added read-only support for Android packages through bsdtar.
 * Reset the GUI if the archive's password isn't entered (correctly).
 * Speed up listing by using static regexes.
 * Handle relative file paths correctly.

V0.4.0
---------
 * Added support for Zstd (because tar supports it).
 * Allow stopping (killing) long processes.
 * Prevent DND when the backend is busy.
 * Smooth scrolling when the mouse wheel turns inside the view.
 * Fixed a potential issue in translations.
 * Enable the "Remove File(s)" action only if an item is selected.
 * Show (optional) prompt before removing items.
 * Show the updated view only after populating and adjusting it.
 * Added an option to select libarchive binary with non-Linux systems.

V0.3.2
---------
 * Added a workaround for the low performance of QMimeDatabase. Loading of heavy archives is much faster now.

V0.3.1
---------
 * Fixed archiving of files from different folders.
 * Fixed a mistake in choosing the archive name on compressing a folder.

V0.3.0
---------
 * Eliminated a rare cause of crash, when the file list contains "/" and "//" (with "application/x-archive", for example).
 * Removed QDesktopWidget::availableGeometry (could have been replaced by QGuiApplication::screens but wasn't needed).

 * Overwrite a Gzip archive if the overwrite prompt is accepted.
 * Always wait for a process (command) to be started before waiting for it to be finished.

 * Remove the temporary extracted files when they are replaced in the archive.
 * Enable selective extraction for 7z ("7z x archive -oDIR path1, path2,…").

V0.2.0
---------
 * Added Preferences dialog.
 * Customizable view icon size.
 * Polish translation by Marcin Mikołajczak (m4sk1n at GitHub).
 * Workaround for a KDE bug that, under some circumstances, doesn't let the application exit when its main window is closed.
 * Focus the view and its first item after updating it.
 * View/expand/collapse the current item with Enter/Return.
 * With tar/bsdtar and if the parent dir exists, change the parent dir name instead of extracting in a child dir.
 * A root archive file may mean a parent directory or a single file. Previously, it was supposed to be a parent directory and that caused single files not to be extracted with non-Gzip archives when they were present in the extraction directory.
 * If a file comes after its containing folder in the command line, bsdtar doesn't extract the folder. A workaround is added for this behavior.
 * Prevent tree collapse after extracting an rpm archive.
 * Don't update the tree unnecessarily.
